This project is a demonstration of a working inventory management system. The project is written in Java and is tested with Maven. The project will also feature Github to Jira integration.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To install this project and set up a test environment you must first ensure that you have the following prerequisites:



```
Java Runtime (JRE) - I am running JRE 1.8 while building this project.
Maven
Eclipse IDE
MySQL
MySQL Workbench / or any DB utility you prefer. EG: NaviCat / DBeaver
```

### Installing



To set up the test environment for this project, first make sure you have all of the required prerequisites. Then open Eclipse and import the maven project. 

Next, in the resources folder of the maven project, find the "db.properties" file and edit them to be the login for your MySQL database account. Next, locate "sql-data.sql" and run it to create the requires databases. 

Now when you open the Runner.java file you should have the working application.

```
The usage of this program is to create, edit, read, and update a databse for customers, orders, and items. The usability is very simple as it is just some basic commands on a command line. 

For example if you wanted to create a customer, when running the program just type "customer" and then "create" when prompted. The application will ask what the Customer's name is, then ask for their surname. Once this data has been collected it will create a new entry to the database with the new customer.
```

## Running the tests

The tests included with this system are made to automatically run the code to see if the results we give it are possible to come back with. There are not enough tests in this project to cover the whole application, but the tests that exist in the project already can cover some of the areas.

```
To run a test, you can open the class that holds the test and click "coverage as, JUnit". To run all of the tests at once, right click on the project itself at "Src/Java" and click coverage as JUnit again.
```

## Deployment

To add this to a live system, make sure that the database properties in the db.properties folder match those that exist with your database, and update the sql-schema to include your tables. 

If your tables are already existing and holding data, you may have to change a few methods in this application such as those found in the DAO classes. The main changes will be to your SQL queries, but if your tables have different columns then this application will not be good to run on your system.
